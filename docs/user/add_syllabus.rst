Adding a syllabus (course outline)
-----------------------------------

A syllabus (commonly referred to as a "course outline" in
many academic units) is a document which pertains to an
individual section of a course, i.e., has instructor
information and meeting times *for a particular instance*.

These documents are referred to generally (in this system)
as "section handouts".

The following directions assume that you (the user) have
the appropriate permissions.

1. Log in to the site admin.  
2. Go to Classes > Section handouts > Add.
3. Click the magnifying glass icon to select the section:
   use the filters for term and course to select the appropriate section.
4. Set a label for this handout, if it should be something other than
   "syllabus".  This will affect how links to this document appear on
   the web site.
5. Set the ordering, if necessary.  Ordering only matters if you have
   more than one section handout. (E.g., generally a syllabus appears
   *first*, before anything else.)
6. Click the "choose file" button to select the appropriate handout
   document.  Best practice is to only distribute PDF files.
   (Tip: On a Mac, you can drag a file onto the "choose file" button
   to select it.)
7. Click "SAVE".
